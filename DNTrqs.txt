Empty project withh MVC references selected in template

RouteConfig class in App_start folder Then called in Application start method of Global.asax.cs

What is modules ,Handlers in MVC

Package.config- all package version details

When adding first view missing packages Bootstrap and jquery are added in the project automatically

Nuget is the package manager

All the public methods in mvc controller are action method(even without actionresult return type)- can be called as get request

Toavoid mishandling, non action methods must not be public or mention as NONAction attribute

we need add Entitiy framework pkg in UI project and add connectionstring details in UI project.because after all only DAL layer dll is added in UI project and It uses the host project configurations only 

Isunicode(false) in CF fluent api - reject/wot store non english characters like not N''

Setting relationship between entities - in fluent api 1 to many , always start from  child entity to create relationship statement

Calling existing sp and sqlfunc in CF as method with Datatbase.sqlquery statment returning typed result

Repository design pattern - minimize duplicate query logic and SOC - application need not know about datasource and additionally access logic and allow unit testing 

Repository implemenetation will be implemeneted in ways - Generic(Add,remove ,find,delete, getall) and specific inheriting generic(entity specific like top some.. get some) 

Entities model and Viewmodel can be placed in separate project

Repository abstration and implementation can be separate project

Repository pattern- dbset
UnitofWork - DbContext - Intialize DbContext and Commiting changes in single place

IOC- Inversion of normal programming(giving objects in needed place instead of creating there )

IOC Implmentation pattern - Service locator, event,delegate ,Dependency injection

Dependency Injection - Constructor injection(passing dependency in constructor),Property setter injection(passing dependency as property value),Method injection (passing dependency as method argument)

Dependency injection is implemented in realtime using IOC containers(pass objects at run time and maintains lifetime of dependency objects) like Unity,Castle windsor,structure map,Ninject


Absratract and other design patterns vs Repo and unit of work
How asp.net  mvc with ang riuting show demo

Conditional Layout can be done in Layout page - based on reading the routedata values in Layout page
RouteData is a property of base Controller class, so RouteData can be accessed in any controller. RouteData contains route information of a current request. You can get the controller, action or parameter information
public ActionResult Index(int? id, string name, int? standardId)
    {
        var controller = RouteData.Values["controller"];
        var action = RouteData.Values["action"];          
        id = (int)RouteData.Values["id"];
        name = (string)RouteData.Values["name"];
        standrdId = (int)RouteData.Values["standardId"];
        var area = RouteData.DataTokens["areaname"];
        return View();
    }


ViewStart.cshtml - Can be used for writing some csharp code for page initialization like setting Layout= variable

Viewlevel Web.config - will contain required csharp and other namespaces, we can add our Custom helper namespaces if required

MVC vs 3Tier - Tier refer/;s to individual Hosted application and Layer refers to BL,DAL,PL

Architectural Pattern[High level - MVC MVVM SOA REST] vs Design Pattern[Code or Component level - Singleton,Abstract design on how the objects are created and maintaned]

We can have multiple routes type in RouteConfig class.Routes will be taken in the order mentioned.

We can use both conventional routing and Attribute[Route("~/Controllername/ActionName/{id}/{catid}")-This can be user defined pathwkh] routing in MVC .To enable attribute routing in MVC , configure it by adding routes.MapMVCAttributeRoutes  in Routingconfig

We can use manual modelstate.Addmodelerror("modelprop","err msg") for each property on post request for forma validations in case if DataAnnotations usage is difficult in some cases like for Boolean type property we can utilize adding modelstate error manually 

Extension methods in C# - like static class with static method.

HTML name attribute is used to post and read data for any language/technology ..php,mvc,webform . Id attribute can used at client side for DOM manipulations. If there are more than one element with same name then we read data as like string[] name at server side to get data from same name array

EditorFor is Templated HTML helper which automtically find datatype from DataAnnotations of property.DataType works with only Templated helper. 

We can create Custom HTML Submit button

We can implement Custom validation attribute by inheriting Valifation attributr class. This will need server side postback for validation to happen and auto hide of validation message on typing wont happen. so for this, Microsoft has provided client side validation nuget packages from jqueryvalidation(jquery.validate.min.js) and Microsofts own libraray(jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js). Thes will help Datatannotation validation to happen in client side itself.But still some controls like check box wont happen at client side, for that we need to implement one more claass in our custom validation for checkbox ie..IClientValidatable and implement its method.
Addition we need to use jquery validations adaptor in the page in separate script block .Please refer practice solution for detail



Inline html helpers - @helper can be used to write C# methods in .cshtml page
