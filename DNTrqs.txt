IOC- Inversion of normal programming(giving objects in needed place instead of creating there )

IOC Implmentation pattern - Service locator, event,delegate ,Dependency injection

Dependency Injection - Constructor injection(passing dependency in constructor),Property setter injection(passing dependency as property value),Method injection (passing dependency as method argument)

Dependency injection is implemented in realtime using IOC containers(pass objects at run time and maintains lifetime of dependency objects) like Unity,Castle windsor,structure map,Ninject
